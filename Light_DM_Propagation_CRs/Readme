In this folder, we show the result of a combined fit to the AMS-02 data of the ratios B/C, B/O, Be/C, Be/O, Li/C, Li/O, Be10/Be and 10Be/9Be without considering correlations in the errors of AMS-02. 
The fitting procedure consists on the Markov-Chain Monte Carlo analysis used in  De la Torre Luque JCAP 11 (2021) 018, [2107.06863] and first presented in De la Torre Luque et al., JCAP 07 (2021) 010, [2102.13238].
We are considering here that the morphology of the Galaxy follows the 4-arm model of Steimann et al. -- . Y. Steiman-Cameron, M. Wolfire, and D. Hollenbach, The Astrophysical Journal 722, 1460252 (2010) --, which shapes the gas and source distribution that we use in our simulation. 

The xml and source.param file are the input files provided to DRAGON to produce the simulations and the results (spectra of the particles) at Earth poisiton are given in the _spectrum.fit.gz file. The map of the electron distribution the Galaxy can be provided upon request.
