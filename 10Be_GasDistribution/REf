In this folder, we provide examples of input files in DRAGON for different variations of the spiral arm distribution. We show examples of the implementation of the Steiman-Cameron 4-arm model (https://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0004-637X/722/2/1460) and the Wainscoat model (https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1992ApJS...83..111W), and for different values of the arm width.
In addition, we include output files which differ in the cross sections for spallation used. Finally, comparison of our fits to the data are shown as png images.
